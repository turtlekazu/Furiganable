# Furiganable

Furiganable is a simple and flexible library for adding furigana (phonetic readings) to text components. It’s designed to be easy to use.

This library is heavily inspired by the [android-compose-furigana](https://github.com/mainrs/android-compose-furigana/) library.

# Features

- Compatible with Compose Multiplatform (Android, iOS)
- Compatible with both Material 2 and Material 3 libraries
- Easily add furigana by using a simple predefined format, such as `[漢字[かんじ]]`.
- Supports Localization

# Variations

This library consists of three modules: `compose-core`, `compose-m2`, and `compose-m3`. Including just one of them is sufficient. Both `compose-m2` and `compose-m3` already include `compose-core`.

Module | Recommended | Description | Use Case
---|---|---|---
`compose-core` | - | A minimal core module with no dependency on Material libraries. Requires passing additional parameters to components. | Ideal for projects that avoid using Material libraries.
`compose-m2` | ✅ | Designed for projects using the Material 2 library. | Use if your project relies on Material 2.
`compose-m3` | ✅ | Designed for projects using the Material 3 library. | Use if your project relies on Material 3.

# Usage

## Add dependency on this library

### Version Catalog

If you're using Version Catalog, add the following to your `libs.versions.toml` file:

```toml
[versions]
#...
furiganable = "<latest-version>"

[libraries]
#...
furiganable = { module = "com.turtlekazu.furiganable:compose-m3", version.ref = "furiganable" }
```

or

```toml
[libraries]
#...
furiganable = { module = "com.turtlekazu.furiganable:compose-m3", version = "<latest-version>" }
```

then

```kotlin
dependencies {
    // ...
    implementation(libs.furiganable)
}
```

### Gradle

If you're using Gradle instead, add the following to your `build.gradle` file:

#### Kotlin DSL

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation("com.turtlekazu.furiganable:compose-m3:<latest-version>")
}
```

#### Groovy DSL

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.turtlekazu.furiganable:compose-m3:<latest-version>'
}
```

## Add component to your composable function

The format to add furigana is like, `[漢字[かんじ]]`.
To recognize the start and end positions of kanji, outer brackets are required.

### Before
```kotlin
@Composable
fun SampleComponent() {
    // ...

    // I want to add furigana to this Text component
    Text(
        text = "これは試験用の文字列です。",
    )
}
```

### After

```kotlin
@Composable
fun SampleComponent() {
    // ...

    // Replace Text component with TextWithReading component
    TextWithReading(
        text = "これは[試験用[しけんよう]]の[文字列[もじれつ]]です。",
    )
}
```

You can use localized string for text with furigana like below

`strings.xml(ja)`
```xml
<string name="sample_text">これは[試験用[しけんよう]]の[文字列[もじれつ]]です。</string>
```

```kotlin
@Composable
fun SampleComponent() {
    // ...

    // You can use localized string with furigana
    TextWithReading(
        text = stringResource(R.string.sample_text),
    )
}
```
